    <h1>Drake</h1>
    <h2>I admire Drake because he’s the perfect example of someone who turned their passion into a global legacy. He’s not just a rapper; he’s a storyteller who makes you feel every lyric, whether it’s about heartbreak, ambition, or celebrating life. His versatility amazes me—he can seamlessly blend genres, collaborate with anyone, and still make every song uniquely his. Beyond music, I respect how he represents Toronto and has built OVO into a cultural powerhouse. He’s proof that staying authentic while evolving is the key to success.</h2>
